# Purpose
Introductory React app following the "React JS Crash Course" tutorial by Brad Traversy. This task tracker app gave me an overview of components, props, state, hooks, APIs, and ReactRouter.

# How to run the application
Make sure npm is installed. To view versions of dependencies, click on `package.json`.

Open the terminal in the directory and type in

- `npm install` (this automatically installs all npm package dependencies)
- `npm run start` (this runs the project and opens locahost:3000 on your default browser)
